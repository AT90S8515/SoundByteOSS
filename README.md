# SoundByte
The current released SoundByte App for UWP

TODO: Explain everything

## TODO
- [ ] Setup the CI engine to process legacy builds.
- [ ] Use GitHub releases
- [ ] Setup automatic staging releases

## What's included
- The publicly released SoundByte app source code (for UWP)
- The core library 

## What's not included
- The web application (server side functionality)
- The new Amalthea engine (rewritten core library to be fully service modular (via extensions) and cross platform)
- The in beta iOS app
- The in beta UWP app

The Amalthea engine, iOS and UWP will eventually be open sourced (the UWP app still requires a lot of code to be ported from the legacy app). The web application is not planned to be open sourced.
